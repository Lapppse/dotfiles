# Dotfiles
This repo contains **my** dotfiles for **personal** use.  
I **do not expect you to use them** as they are tailored for myself, 
but I'm planning on providing `install scripts` for some of the dotfiles.

# What dotfiles does the repo have?
Currently there are dotfiles for:
- [artix and arch mirrorlists](mirrors)
- [grub](grub)
- [nvidia drivers](nvidia)
- [hyprland](hyprland)
- [waybar](waybar)

# [REDACTED]
As some of the dotfiles contain information I don't want to share (e.g. passwords or other sensitive data), 
I remove it before pushing to this repo and mark it as _[REDACTED]_.  
I'm planning on making install scripts that would fill the data in or giving instructions how to do that on your own.
